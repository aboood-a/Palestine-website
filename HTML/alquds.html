            <h2>üåø Introduction </h2>
            <p>
                Al-Quds, known in Arabic as Al-Quds, is one of the most ancient and sacred cities
                in the world. Its golden domes rise above stone streets, surrounded by olive trees and 
                centuries of history. For thousands of years, Al-Quds has been a center of faith, culture, 
                and beauty. It is a city where the call to prayer from Al-Aqsa Mosque echoes alongside the bells 
                of churches, and where every stone carries the memory of generations.

            <h2>üìñ Historical Background</h2>
            <p>
                Al-Quds has been inhabited for thousands of years and holds spiritual significance for 
                Muslims, Christians, and Jews alike. For Palestinians, it has always been the heart of culture 
                and identity. Before occupation, Al-Quds thrived with lively markets, schools, traditional crafts, 
                and a rich social life. The Old City, with its four quarters‚ÄîMuslim, Christian, Armenian, and Jewish‚Äîhas 
                long been a symbol of coexistence and heritage.

            <h2>The Occupation of Al-Quds</h2>
            
                <h3>Before the Occupation</h3>
                <p>
                    Jerusalem has always been a major religious, cultural, and historical center. It holds deep significance for all three Abrahamic 
                    religions and has been a symbol of Palestinian identity for centuries. Before the occupation, Jerusalem thrived under Ottoman rule 
                    and later the British Mandate. During this time, Zionist ambitions increased, especially following the Balfour Declaration of 1917, 
                    which promised the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.
            </p>
                <h3>The Nakba and Western Jerusalem (1948)</h3>
                <p>In 1948, following the declaration of the State of the occupation and the outbreak of the Nakba war, the occupation forces 
                occupied Western Jerusalem, including several historic Arab neighborhoods.
                Thousands of Palestinian families were forcibly expelled from their homes.
                Meanwhile, Eastern Jerusalem, including the Old City, Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, remained under Jordanian administration.</p>

                <h3>Eastern Quds Occupation (1967)</h3>
                <p>During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel attacked several Arab countries and occupied the remainder of Palestine, including Eastern Jerusalem.
                On June 7, 1967, the occupation's forces entered the Old City through the Lion‚Äôs Gate (Bab al-Asbat).
                The occupation flag was raised over Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Western Wall (Wailing Wall).
                the occupation declared the annexation of East Jerusalem as part of a ‚Äúunified capital,‚Äù a move widely rejected by the international community.</p>

                <h3>After the Occupation</h3>
                <p>Entire Palestinian neighborhoods, such as Moroccan Quarter, were demolished to create sites like the Western Wall Plaza.
                Policies of land confiscation, identity restrictions, settlement construction, and demographic changes were implemented to alter the character of the city.
                Despite these pressures, Al-Quds livers have remained resilient, preserving their Arab, and Islamic identity.

            <p>
                Palestinians in Al-Quds face numerous challenges due to the ongoing occupation. Many live under the threat of 
                home demolitions, restrictions on movement, and limited access to services. The Israeli government has implemented 
                policies that make it difficult for Palestinians to maintain their residency status in the city.
                <h4>Palestinians face:</h4>
                Checkpoints and barriers that limit freedom of movement.
                Home demolitions in neighborhoods such as Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan.
                Restrictions on worship, where many Palestinians are denied access to Al-Aqsa.
                Settlement expansion, changing the character of Palestinian neighborhoods.

            <p>
                Despite decades of struggle, Al-Qudsites continue to preserve their identity. 
                They protect their traditions through embroidery (tatreez), storytelling, prayer gatherings, and food 
                like maqluba and kanafeh. Every Friday, thousands still gather at Al-Aqsa, proving that the spirit of Al-Quds cannot 
                be erased.Despite the hardships, Al-Quds's Palestinians continue to hold onto their culture, traditions, and faith. 
                Community organizations work tirelessly to support families, preserve heritage, and advocate for rights. 
                Festivals, art, and education are vibrant parts of life in Al-Quds, showcasing the enduring spirit of its people.

            <p>
                The situation in Al-Quds is a reminder of the broader Palestinian struggle for justice and rights. 
                International solidarity is crucial in supporting the people of Al-Quds. By raising awareness, advocating for human rights, 
                and supporting Palestinian-led initiatives, we can help ensure that Al-Quds remains a city of faith, culture, and resilience.

            <h2>To finish with</h2>
            <p>
                Al-Quds is not only a place of history; it is a living city that breathes faith, beauty, and resistance. 
                To know Al-Quds is to witness both its light and its pain. Journalism about Al-Quds is not just about 
                reporting events‚Äîit is about giving voice to the people who live here, protecting memory, and reminding the 
                world that this city, with all its holiness and heart, still belongs to its people.
