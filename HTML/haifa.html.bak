            <h2>üìñ Historical Background</h2>
            <p>
                Haifa has been inhabited since ancient times and has long served as a center for commerce and culture. 
                Before the occupation, it was a bustling city with Arabs, Jews, and Christians living together. The port 
                of Haifa was one of the main gateways to Palestine, facilitating trade and travel across the Mediterranean. 
                Its neighborhoods, markets, schools, and religious institutions reflected the city‚Äôs diversity and rich cultural life.

            <h2>The Occupation of Haifa</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>Before the Occupation</h3>
                In the years leading up to 1948, Haifa was a thriving city with a mixed population. Arabs made up the 
                majority of the population, living in neighborhoods such as Wadi Nisnas, Karm Al-Mina, and the German Colony.
                Haifa‚Äôs port and its surrounding areas were crucial for trade, transportation, and employment, 
                connecting Palestine to the Mediterranean and the world.
                Tensions grew due to the rise of Zionist militias and the support of the British authorities during the 
                Mandate period. Many Arab neighborhoods prepared for potential conflicts, but the city largely maintained daily 
                life and commerce.

                <h3>1948 ‚Äì The Nakba and Occupation</h3>
                In April‚ÄìMay 1948, during the 1948 Arab-Occupation War, Haifa became a major battleground.
                On April 21, 1948, the Haganah, the main Jewish paramilitary force, launched Operation Bi‚Äôur Hametz to control Haifa.
                Many Palestinian neighborhoods were attacked with shelling and armed assaults, leading to 
                panic and mass flight of residents.
                Tens of thousands of Palestinians left the city, many seeking refuge in Acre, Nazareth, 
                and Lebanon. Some families were expelled forcibly, while others fled voluntarily due to fear of violence.
                By May 23, 1948, Haifa was fully under Occupation control. The city‚Äôs Arab population decreased 
                dramatically‚Äîfrom roughly 65,000 Arabs before the war to less than a few thousand who remained.

                <h3>After 1948</h3>
                Palestinian properties, homes, and businesses were confiscated by the new Occupation authorities.
                Many Arab neighborhoods were demolished or repurposed, while Jewish immigrants 
                from Europe and other regions were settled in their place.
                The port, which had been central to Palestinian trade, became a major Occupation port.
                The demographic and cultural landscape of Haifa changed almost overnight.

            <h2>‚öñÔ∏è Life Under Occupation</h2>
            <p>
                Most Palestinians were expelled in 1948; those who remained faced restrictions on property, 
                employment, and access to the port.
                The confiscation of homes and lands changed the city‚Äôs social fabric permanently.
                Palestinian Haifans were often marginalized in urban planning and public services, while new 
                settlements and Israeli developments replaced much of the historic neighborhoods.
